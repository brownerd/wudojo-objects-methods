// Non-standard

// This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.



// The Array.observe() method is used for asynchronously observing changes to Arrays, similar to Object.observe() for objects. It provides a stream of changes in order of occurrence. It's equivalent to Object.observe() invoked with the accept type list ["add", "update", "delete", "splice"].
